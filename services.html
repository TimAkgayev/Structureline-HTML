  <div class="services_wrapper" id="Conclusion">
    <p>Designing buildings requires architects to put themselves in the perspective of a building’s future users and to predict the likely patterns of use in the building. At the same time they must generate shapes and forms corresponding to the expected user needs. This process of designing buildings, whilst considering all these issues, is difficult for several reasons. First to our wide experience, no adequate model of human behaviour is taught in architecture schools and second no systematic approach is known on how to use this information to generate shape and form.</p>
    <p>To present a discussion about architectural design, it is necessary to identify the theoretical perspectives behind architecture. The application of positive theories – witch require a thorough understanding about the users and their behaviors in space. Understanding the human nature of thinking and reasoning mechanism as the central issue of the design and process plays a major role in this research. This research will involve examining the methodology of the design process in architecture. It is directed toward architectural education and so will review current educational issues facing schools as well as the background of architectural education. </p>
